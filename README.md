Providing a Cultural and Environmental Site to Make Your Hiking Trip Easier
We offer suggestions based on what you want in natural places and provide information and data about them.
How to Protect the Environment?
Enviroseek allows you to add notes about the cleanliness of the area and other pollution or geographical issues. This feedback helps volunteers and responsible parties improve these areas.
Enviroseek was created from our sense of belonging and responsibility towards the environment and citizens. The site addresses some environmental issues and offers wellness and enjoyment services to its users as follows:
What Services Does Enviroseek Offer?
1.	The site allows users who want to go on a trip to specify the features of the place they want to visit. For example: summer spot, family-friendly, with restrooms. The site will then provide locations with these features.
2.	It offers explorers a tool to find new places in Jordan. Users can search the map for places they haven’t visited before and continue exploring Jordan’s wild nature to fulfill their passion.
3.	Explorers can add the places they have visited to Enviroseek, allowing others to get information and find new places to explore or enjoy.
4.	Tourists, citizens, or explorers can give feedback about the places they visited. When someone wants to choose a place to enjoy, they can see previous visitors’ reviews and ratings to have a trip with the desired features.
How Can the Site Help the Environment?
A healthy environment keeps the ecosystem balanced, helping all living things grow and develop.
1.	The site provides a map of Jordan showing places with environmental issues marked with red dots, such as forest pollution from human waste, sea and river pollution from trash, tree fires due to weather or human use, landslides, etc.
2.	Responsible parties or volunteers can go to these places to help and improve the environment.
3.	Volunteers can systematically find areas needing help instead of randomly, as is often the case now.
4.	When an issue in a red-marked area is resolved and cleaned, it will turn green on the map, indicating that it is now a clean natural area.
5.	Solving these issues will provide a clean environment for humans, wild and aquatic animals, and plants, creating a balanced ecosystem.
